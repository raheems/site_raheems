I am a Data Scientist and Statistician with more than 17 years of experience in academia and industry combined. Currently, as a healthcare data scientist, I provide strategic guidance for the development, validation, and use of algorithms for data based decision making.

I have advanced level of proficiency with **R**, and working knowledge with **Python**. I use **SAS** for management of structured data and for standard statistical analysis.
