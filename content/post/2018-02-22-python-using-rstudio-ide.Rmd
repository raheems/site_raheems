This is test post to check if Python code works. This is test.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
import numpy as np
x = [1, 2, 3]
print(x)
y = np.mean(x)
```

$\bar{x}$ is the average, which is defined as 
\[
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x}{n}
\]

So what is the aveage of ```y```? It is ```r py$y```.

```{r}
x = c(1:5)
```

The value of x is R session is ```r x```.

More text is to be added.
