abstract = "We provide specific recommendations for addressing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in developing countries from the viewpoint of Bangladesh. Developing countries lack necessary healthcare facilities, skilled professionals and resources to deal with rising burden of ASD. This underscores the need for developing strategies that could work within cultural and economic barrier. We propose an innovative model for primary screening of ASD by utilizing well-established nationwide vaccination program in Bangladesh. Moreover, ICT-based intervention  should be promoted to adapt best practices found elsewhere in the local context. Our recommendations would also be useful for other resource-limited countries."
