abstract = "The adolescent and young adult (AYA) age group (15–39 years) bears distinct characteristics in terms of cancer biology, long-term health and treatment-related complications and psychosocial aspects. The overall scenario of cancer including hematological malignancies (HMs) is largely unknown in Bangladesh, where a significant proportion of people (44% of total population) belong to AYA age group. This study aims to describe the patterns of HM among AYA in the context of Bangladesh."
