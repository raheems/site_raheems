    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p class="pub-abstract" itemprop="text">An adaptation research under Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) funded LACC-II project started at coastal saline area of Laudove, Dakope upzila in Khulna district of Bangladesh through on-farm research division of Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI), Khulna Bangladesh during May-June 2008 to May-June 2009.
