      <description>If you are exploring the hot field of Data Science today, you probably know by now that there is no unique way to define data science. Everyone’s perspective comes from their respective backgrounds. Statisticians think they are data scientists while CS folks think they are.

Both have truth in their arguments as the typical problems they solve are quite different. There are some exceptions where their workflows overlap.</description>

      <description>I would like to share a few things with you from recent experience of my transition from academia to industry. Of course I have a lot more experience than a fresh graduate, but something I’ve experienced that many others may benefit from. I believe this will help you to think at least. I’ve written this with the candidates in the US job market in mind.
Firstly, I would say this– lies, damn lies, statistics, AND one-page resume.</description>
